I used zomato's restaurant dataset from Kaggle.
### Introduction:
The exploration and analysis of the Zomato restaurant dataset aimed to understand the distribution and characteristics of restaurants across various cities in India. This data, derived from Zomato's extensive database, provides valuable insights into restaurant types, popularity, and service quality. The analysis included data cleaning, deduplication, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to draw meaningful conclusions about the restaurant industry in India.

The primary objectives were:
- To identify the number of unique restaurants.
- To analyze restaurant chains and single-outlet establishments.

2. **Chain vs. Single-Outlets**:
   - **Chain Restaurants**: Out of the total unique restaurants, approximately **60%** were part of chains, showcasing the dominance of well-established brands and their widespread presence across various cities.
   - **Single-Outlets**: The remaining **40%** were unique, single-outlet establishments, indicating a strong representation of standalone or local businesses in the dataset.
3. **Top Cities for Restaurants**:

### Final Thoughts:
This analysis provided a comprehensive overview of India's restaurant landscape, showcasing the prevalence of both chain and standalone establishments. The findings can aid business decisions, such as identifying market saturation points and potential areas for expansion. Furthermore, this study can be a stepping stone for more detailed analyses, such as exploring customer feedback, pricing strategies, and geographical trends in greater detail.

These insights contribute to understanding the competitive nature of the restaurant industry and emphasize the importance of maintaining high standards to attract and retain customers, whether as part of a chain or an independent establishment.
